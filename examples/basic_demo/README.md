# FastFlowTransform project scaffold

This project was created with `fft init`.
Next steps:
1. Update `profiles.yml` with real connection details (docs/Profiles.md).
2. Add sources in `sources.yml` and author models under `models/` (docs/Config_and_Macros.md).
3. Seed sample data with `fft seed` and execute models with `fft run` (docs/Quickstart.md).

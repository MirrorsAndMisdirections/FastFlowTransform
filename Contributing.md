## üìå How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

* Use GitHub Issues.
* Include reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, logs and version (`flowforge --version`).

### Suggesting Features

* Reference similar tools or patterns if applicable.

### Pull Requests

* Fork the repo and create a feature branch (`feat/<short-name>`).
* Keep PRs focused (one change set per PR).
* Include tests where possible.
* Update docs (README/examples) if behavior changes.
* Run `pre-commit` hooks before pushing.
* Ensure CI passes (lint, typecheck, tests).

### Commit Messages

* Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) when possible.

  * `feat: add postgres executor`
  * `fix: handle missing sources.yml`
  * `docs: update quickstart`
  * `chore: bump version`
